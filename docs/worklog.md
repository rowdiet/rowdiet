## 2026-07-23 — v1 built from the spike handoff

- Repo scaffolded from the rowdiet spike bundle (GO decision, architecture, verified type table,
  build order all inherited from the spike's three-axis research).
- `rowdiet-core`: tolerant splitter, sqlparser-0.62 extraction behind the `DdlOp` boundary,
  version-ordered folding (CREATE/ADD/DROP/RENAME/SET TYPE/SET NOT NULL, session types via
  CREATE TYPE/DOMAIN replay), pg_type-verified alignment catalog with proven-short typmod
  upgrade, exact/estimate two-tier reporting with MAXALIGN footprint honesty and the
  suggested-order heuristic (align desc, irregulars last, varlena tail).
- `rowdiet` CLI: files/dirs/stdin, `--format text|json|github`, `--fail-over` gate (exit 1),
  `--suggest`, `--rows`, `--assume-type`; `-- rowdiet:ignore` exemption.
- 90 tests green (76 core unit, 6 render, 7 CLI integration, 1 doctest); clippy clean;
  `rowdiet-core` checks on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with `--no-default-features` (the wasm
  boundary holds: fs behind the default `fs` feature, serde optional).
- libpg_query wasm feasibility re-verified empirically on Sergey's mid-session request
  (background agent): prior blanket "not feasible" overturned — builds AND runs on emscripten
  and wasip1 targets (novel result, recipes recorded) — but wasm-bindgen integration is
  structurally blocked, so sqlparser-rs stays primary. Verdict:
  `~/projs/rowdiet-spike/research/libpg-query-wasm-verdict.md`.
- Bridges armed: ukb author session (research context) and bringmeto (first adopter, co-design)
  via `/tmp/agent-bridge/rowdiet/`.

Next (per README roadmap): wasm webpage (step 2), libpg_query native oracle in CI, curated
extension type map, in-group exact search for multi-irregular tables, squawk upstream offer.
